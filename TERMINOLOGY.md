# Terminology
Must stay consistent!

A lot of terminology doesn't make sense, so we're trying to use some that does:

- `bundle`: bundle, package
- `codepack`: 
- `compile`: compile, build
- `compiler`: a compiler
- `include`: include, import
- `link`: link
- `pack`: to align in RAM / store without padding
- `type`: data type, data definition, memory layout

## Corrections
- "build" -> "compile"
- "library", "shared object", "lib", "so", "dll" -> "codepack"
- "package" -> "bundle"

## Differences
- A `link` happens at runtime, and `include` happens at compile time (the code is included in your compiled ).
