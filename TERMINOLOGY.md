# Terminology
This is an opinionated list of Aratar approved words and abbreviations for each
technology concept.  This list is designed to eliminate ambiguities.

Additionally, acronyms are avoided while abbreviations are welcomed as they are
more meaningful and easier to remember.  Words that are commonly needed to
describe non-comp-sci things in comp-sci are added, usually with description
"physical" - especially if they are sometimes used as computer science words.

## Corrections
 - "type your name" â†’ "enter your name"

## Differences
- A `link` happens at runtime, and `include` happens at compile time (the code is included in your compiled).
